## c programming drawbacks(limitations):

    1. functions based(procedural language).
    2. limitations group based development.
    3. no reuse of function names.
    4. either complete hiding or expose.
    5. lack of abstraction for ex Struct.
    6. RAII - Resource acquisition of Initialsed, means
        scope based memory usage.


## OOP

    ## Let's you are standing by side of highway,
       looking at the vehicles what all you notice

       ## Outside : 

            1. Light
            2. Compay/ Make
            3. Type : Sedan/Suv/Hatchback
            4. Kind : Car/ Bus/ Tractor etc
            5. Slow / fast / speed / acceleration.


        ## Inside : 

            1. Engine : Electric / RPM / Torque
            2. Entertainment
            3. Mileage
            4. Gear / Current gear
            5. 4x4 / 2x2


        

    ## Class is the code while object is the representation of that code in main memory.

    ## What is concrete we can call it object(bundle of memory in main memory)

        ## Object consist of states : changeable, static
        ## Object consist of behaviour : Drivable, Braking, Acceleration , Gear Shift, Steering etc.

        ## UML :
